# What is GAN?
**GAN** stands for Generative Adversarial Networks. These kinds of networks are used for developing synthetic data generation. It combines two different models to achieve this task namely Generator and Discrimintor models:- 
```diff
+ Generator model
Generator

+ Discriminator model
A discriminative model is one typically used for classification in machine learning. They learn how to distinguish between classes and are often called classifiers. These take a set of features X, such as having a wet nose or whether it purrs and from these features determine a category why of whether the image is of a dog or a cat. In other words, they try to model the probability of class Y given a set of features X as having a wet nose, but it doesn't purr, so it's probably a dog.
